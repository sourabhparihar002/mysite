<h1 class="man"> What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
<p>Lorem Ipsum is a simple dummy text from the printing and lettering industry.
   Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text since 1500, when an
   unknown printer took a sample and created a sample book. It not only survived
    for five centuries, but it remained basically unchanged even after making the
    leap into electronic media. It became popular in the 1960s with the release
     of the letter containing the Letraset Lorem Ipsum excerpt, and recently
      became more prevalent with desktop publishing software, including versions
       of Aldus PageMaker Lorem Ipsum.</p></div>
<div class="last">
<h1 class="man">  Why do we use it?</h1>
<p>  It is a long established fact that when a reader views a page's page, it will
   be distracted by readable content. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it
    has a more or less normal distribution of letters, instead of using 'Content
     here, content here', it should be used as readable English. Many desktop
     publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default
      model text, and a search for "Lorem Ipsum" now exposes many web sites in its
       infancy. Its various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
       accident, sometimes on purpose (to add humor and affection).</p>
